Basic chessboard GUI using Tkinter. It creates an 8x8 grid of labels to represent the chessboard, with alternating colors. The create_piece method can be used to add chess pieces to the board, specifying the row, column, color, and piece type. You can customize it to add your own chess pieces.

To run this code, you'll need to have Tkinter installed. You can install it using pip: pip install tkinter. After running the code, a window will open showing the chessboard. You can add your own logic to handle game rules, player moves, and more.
